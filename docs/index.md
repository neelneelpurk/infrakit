# InfraKit

*Build production-ready infrastructure faster.*

**spec-kit for IaC, with a multi-persona pipeline — specify what you need, let four AI personas review it, generate the code.**

## What is InfraKit?

InfraKit is [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) for infrastructure-as-code. Instead of writing YAML or HCL by hand, you describe what infrastructure you need — InfraKit routes the spec through four specialized personas (Cloud Solutions Engineer → Cloud Architect → Cloud Security Engineer → IaC Engineer), produces a plan, and generates production-ready manifests through a structured **spec → plan → implement → review** pipeline.

Each infrastructure resource gets its own **track** under `.infrakit_tracks/tracks/`, containing the spec, plan, and auto-generated task list. Multiple tracks can run in parallel, and every step is transparent and user-controlled.

InfraKit supports **Crossplane** (Kubernetes-native IaC), **Terraform** (HashiCorp IaC), and **AWS CloudFormation**. Support for Pulumi and OpenTofu is on the roadmap.

- [Quick Start Guide](quickstart.md)
- [Upgrade Guide](upgrade.md)

## Core Philosophy

The InfraKit pipeline is built on four ideas:

- **Spec before code** — define *what* the resource must do before any HCL or YAML is written
- **Multi-persona review** — Cloud Solutions Engineer, Cloud Architect, Cloud Security Engineer, and IaC Engineer each own a distinct phase
- **Never guess schemas** — all `apiVersion` / argument names are verified against provider documentation before code is written
- **Standards enforced** — mandatory tagging, secure defaults, and provider config baked in from the start

## Development Phases

| Phase | Focus | Key Activities |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Greenfield** | New infrastructure resources | Spec, architect review, security review, plan, implement, code review |
| **Brownfield** | Update existing compositions | Scan existing code, generate update spec, review changes, implement delta |

## Agent Personas

InfraKit uses four specialized AI personas, each with a distinct scope:

| Persona | Role | Phase |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Cloud Solutions Engineer** | Gathers requirements, writes spec | Phase 1 |
| **Cloud Architect** | Reviews architecture, reliability, cost | Phase 2 |
| **Cloud Security Engineer** | Audits against compliance frameworks (SOC2, HIPAA, etc.) | Phase 2.5 |
| **IaC Engineer** | Implements spec to verified Crossplane / Terraform / CloudFormation code | Phase 3 |
