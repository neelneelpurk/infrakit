## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for template name and directory. If either is missing, ask for them (one at a time).

---

## System Directive

You are guiding the user through creating a new AWS CloudFormation template. This command orchestrates a multi-persona workflow: Cloud Solutions Engineer → Cloud Architect Review → Cloud Security Engineer Review → spec confirmed.

CloudFormation is AWS-only — the cloud provider is always AWS; do not ask which provider.

**CRITICAL**: Ask only one question at a time. Wait for a response before asking the next question.

---

## Phase 1: Setup Check

### 1.1 Verify Required Files

| File | Path | Required |
|------|------|----------|
| Project Context | `.infrakit/context.md` | ✅ Yes |
| Coding Style | `.infrakit/coding-style.md` | ✅ Yes |
| Tagging | `.infrakit/tagging-standard.md` | ✅ Yes |
| Track Registry | `.infrakit_tracks/tracks.md` | ✅ Yes |

**If any file is missing:**
> "❌ Project not fully initialized. Run `/infrakit:setup` to initialize."
**HALT**

### 1.2 Read Configuration

Read `.infrakit/context.md`, `.infrakit/coding-style.md`, and `.infrakit/tagging-standard.md` before proceeding.

---

## Phase 2: Argument Collection

### 2.1 Template Name

If not provided in `$ARGUMENTS`, ask:

> "What is the name for this template?
>
> Examples: `s3-secure-bucket`, `rds-postgres`, `vpc`"

**WAIT** for response.

### 2.2 Template Directory

If not provided, ask:

> "Where should the template files be created?
>
> Example: `./templates/s3-secure-bucket`"

**WAIT** for response.

### 2.3 Validate Directory

Check if the directory exists and is non-empty:

```bash
test -d <template_directory> && ls -A <template_directory>
```

**If the directory is NOT empty:**

> "⚠️ The directory `<template_directory>` already contains files.
>
> A) **Continue** — files may be overwritten
> B) **Choose a different directory**
> C) **Use update instead** — Run `/infrakit:update_cloudformation_code` to modify existing templates
> D) **Cancel**"

**WAIT** for response.

**If the directory does not exist**, create it:
```bash
mkdir -p <template_directory>
```

### 2.4 Create Track

Generate a track name: `<template-name>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>`

Example: `s3-secure-bucket-20260101-120000`

Create the track directory:
```bash
mkdir -p .infrakit_tracks/tracks/<track-name>
```

Register in `.infrakit_tracks/tracks.md` — add a row with Status `🔵 initializing`.

> "✅ Track created: `<track-name>`
> Location: `.infrakit_tracks/tracks/<track-name>/`"

---

## Phase 3: Cloud Solutions Engineer — Spec Generation

This phase is **interactive** — you and the user iterate on requirements via clarifying questions. Run it **inline** in your current context regardless of whether your harness supports subagents: a subagent can't pause to wait for user input, so a `Task`-style delegation would either guess answers or hang.

Adopt the Cloud Solutions Engineer persona by reading `.infrakit/agent_personas/cloud_solutions_engineer.md` and following its behaviour for the duration of Phase 3. When Phase 4 begins, the persona will be swapped (and on Claude Code, the entire review will run in an isolated subagent — see Phase 4 below).

> "I'll now guide you through creating a specification for this template.
> Acting as the **Cloud Solutions Engineer**, I'll ask clarifying questions."

### 3.1 Initial Questions

**Question 1: Description**

> "Please describe what this template should provision.
>
> Examples:
> - 'An RDS PostgreSQL instance with daily backups and encryption at rest'
> - 'An S3 bucket for storing application logs with versioning enabled'
> - 'A VPC with public and private subnets across two AZs'
>
> Describe your template:"

**WAIT** for response.

### 3.2 Service Disambiguation

If the user's description maps to multiple possible AWS services, present each option in a structured table and ask the user to choose before continuing.

### 3.3 Requirements Questions

Ask the following questions, one at a time:

**Question 2: Environment**

> "What environment is this for?
>
> A) Development (minimal cost, single instance)
> B) Staging (production-like, but smaller)
> C) Production (HA, encrypted, secure)
> D) Flexible (caller specifies via the `Environment` parameter)"

**WAIT** for response.

**Question 3: Security Requirements**

Generate security options relevant to the resource type. Always include 'Type your own requirements' as the last option.

**WAIT** for response.

**Question 4: Parameters**

Generate parameter options relevant to the resource type. These are the `Parameters` the caller will supply at deploy time.

**WAIT** for response.

**Question 5: Outputs**

Generate output options relevant to the resource type. These are the values the template will expose (and optionally `Export` for cross-stack use).

**WAIT** for response.

### 3.4 Generate spec.md

Write to `.infrakit_tracks/tracks/<track-name>/spec.md`:

```markdown
# Specification: <Template Name>

## Description
<What this template provisions — in business/user terms>

## Cloud Provider
**Provider**: AWS
**Service**: <specific service, e.g. "AWS RDS PostgreSQL">

## Project Type
Greenfield (Create new)

## How It Should Work
<Expected behavior from a user's perspective>

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| <name> | <CFN type> | <yes/no> | <default> | <what it controls> |

## Outputs

| Output | Source | Exported | Description |
|--------|--------|----------|-------------|
| <name> | `!GetAtt <LogicalId>.<Attribute>` | <yes/no> | <what value is exposed> |

## Security Requirements
- <requirement 1>
- <requirement 2>

## Configuration Constraints
- <constraint 1>
- <constraint 2>

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Caller can deploy the template with minimal parameter configuration
- [ ] All required security measures are enforced
- [ ] Outputs expose all values callers (or dependent stacks) need
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Template passes `cfn-lint`
```

### 3.5 Spec Feedback Loop

> "I've generated the specification.
>
> **File**: `.infrakit_tracks/tracks/<track-name>/spec.md`
>
> What would you like to do?
>
> A) **Regenerate** — Tell me what to change and I'll regenerate
> B) **Manual Changes** — Edit the file yourself, say 'done' when ready
> C) **Proceed** — Looks good, move to architect review"

**WAIT** for response. Loop until user chooses C.

## Phase 4: Cloud Architect Review (delegated subagent on Claude)

This phase is **read-only against a finalised spec** — no user input mid-flight. That makes it the right shape to delegate to a subagent: the architect's reasoning gets its own context window, uncontaminated by the Solutions Engineer's Q&A history.

**On Claude Code (`Task` tool with custom subagent type):**

Invoke the `Task` tool with:

- `subagent_type`: `cloud-architect` (registered at `.claude/agents/cloud-architect.md`)
- `description`: `"Cloud Architect review of <track-name>"`
- `prompt`: `"Review .infrakit_tracks/tracks/<track-name>/spec.md against the project standards in .infrakit/{context,coding-style,tagging-standard}.md. Return the structured findings report in the format defined in your persona. Do not modify any files."`

The persona file already tells the subagent what to read, what report format to return, and what NOT to do — that's the whole point of registering it as a custom subagent. Keep the orchestrator's invocation prompt one paragraph.

When the subagent returns its report, paste it into your reply to the user and continue with the feedback loop below.

**On Codex / Gemini / Copilot / generic (no custom-subagent primitive):**

Switch context inline. Read `.infrakit/agent_personas/cloud_architect.md` and adopt that persona explicitly. Mark the boundary in your reply ("entering Cloud Architect phase"). Run the review and return the same report format. Then return to the orchestrator persona.

---

In either case, **DO NOT modify `spec.md` automatically. Present findings first.**

> "**Architecture Review Complete**
>
> What would you like to do?
>
> A) **Apply recommendations** — I'll update spec.md
> B) **Skip** — Proceed without changes
> C) **Discuss** — Explain a specific finding"

**WAIT** for response. Apply changes if requested, then confirm.

---

## Phase 5: Cloud Security Engineer Review (delegated when subagents are available)

Same shape as Phase 4: read-only audit against a finalised spec, so it benefits from subagent isolation when available. The one nuance is the **framework-selection question** — that has to happen *before* the subagent is invoked, because subagents can't wait for user input.

### 5.1 Resolve compliance frameworks (context.md first; ask only if missing)

**Read `.infrakit/context.md` first.** Look for a `## Compliance` (or `## Security & Compliance` → `### Compliance Frameworks`) section that names the project's frameworks. Recognised names: SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, NIST 800-53, FedRAMP, CIS Benchmarks.

**If context.md declares frameworks**, announce what you found and proceed:

> "Using compliance frameworks declared in `.infrakit/context.md`: **<frameworks>**."

**If context.md is silent on compliance**, only then ask:

> "`.infrakit/context.md` does not declare a compliance scope. Which security compliance frameworks apply to this resource? Select all that apply: SOC 2, HIPAA, ISO 27001, CIS, NIST, PCI-DSS, or 'None'.
>
> *(Tip: add a `## Compliance` section to `.infrakit/context.md` so this question doesn't appear on future tracks.)*"

**WAIT** for response.

### 5.2 Run the audit

**On Claude Code (`Task` tool with custom subagent type):**

Invoke the `Task` tool with:

- `subagent_type`: `cloud-security-engineer` (registered at `.claude/agents/cloud-security-engineer.md`)
- `description`: `"Cloud Security Engineer audit of <track-name>"`
- `prompt`: `"Audit .infrakit_tracks/tracks/<track-name>/spec.md against these frameworks: {frameworks chosen in step 5.1}. Return the structured findings report in the format defined in your persona. Do not modify any files."`

The persona file tells the subagent what to read, what report format to return, and what NOT to do. Keep the orchestrator's prompt one sentence.

Paste the returned report into your reply to the user and continue with the feedback loop below.

**On Codex / Gemini / Copilot / generic (no custom-subagent primitive):**

Switch context inline. Read `.infrakit/agent_personas/cloud_security_engineer.md` and adopt that persona explicitly. Mark the boundary in your reply ("entering Cloud Security Engineer phase"). Audit against the selected frameworks and return the same report format. Then return to the orchestrator persona.

---

**DO NOT modify `spec.md` automatically. Present findings first.**

> "**Security Review Complete**
>
> What would you like to do?
>
> A) **Apply fixes** — I'll update spec.md
> B) **Waive a finding** — Document an exception with justification
> C) **Skip** — Proceed without changes"

**WAIT** for response. Apply changes or document waivers if requested.

---

## Phase 6: Debate and Final Spec Confirmation

Present a combined summary of both reviews:

> "**Review Summary for `<template-name>`**
>
> | Review | Verdict | Issues |
> |--------|---------|--------|
> | Architecture | <verdict> | <N> findings |
> | Security | <verdict> | <N> findings |
>
> **Recommended changes applied**: <list>
> **Waived**: <list>
>
> Please review the final spec:
> **File**: `.infrakit_tracks/tracks/<track-name>/spec.md`
>
> What would you like to do?
>
> A) **Confirm** — Spec is finalized, proceed
> B) **Make changes** — Edit the spec, say 'done' when ready
> C) **Re-run a review** — Run architect or security review again"

**WAIT** for response. Loop until user confirms.

---

## Phase 7: Register Track as Spec-Generated

Update `.infrakit_tracks/tracks.md` — change the track's Status to `📝 spec-generated`.

> "✅ **Spec finalized for `<template-name>`!**
>
> **Track**: `<track-name>`
> **Files created:**
> - `.infrakit_tracks/tracks/<track-name>/spec.md` — Specification
>
> **Next step**: Run `/infrakit:plan <track-name>` to generate the implementation plan."

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Setup files missing | Halt, direct to `/infrakit:setup` |
| Directory not empty | Warn, present options |
| Directory creation fails | Report error, suggest manual creation |
| User rejects spec | Ask for specific changes, revise |
| Breaking change detected in security review | Require explicit waiver with justification |
